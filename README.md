# SQLChat: Natural Language Queries and Insights via SQL

SQLChat is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload data files, interact via a chat interface, and use natural language processing to convert text into SQL commands. The application then executes these SQL commands to query the uploaded data and provide insights, all through an intuitive chat interface.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Supports multiple data formats including CSV, XLS, XLSX, XLSM, and XLSB.
- **Convert Natural Language to SQL**: Users can input queries in natural language, which the app processes into SQL commands.
- **Execute SQL Queries**: The app executes these SQL commands on uploaded data files.
- **Display Insights**: Insights from the SQL queries are displayed back to the user in natural language.
